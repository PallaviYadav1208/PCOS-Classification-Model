Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem with hormones that happens during the reproductive years. If you have PCOS , you may not have periods very often. Or you may have periods that last many days. You may also have too much of a hormone called androgen in your body.

I have performed various classification algorithms to predict whether a female has PCOS or Not
